# SeeFood

## Concept
SeeFood is a iOS app created using SwiftUI, ARKit and CoreML based on the app with the same name from the show Sillicon Valley. The app uses the iPhone camera and camera roll to take a picture and then, because of a CoreML model made for identifying objects, it is capable of informing the user what the main object of the picture is.

## Purpose
This repository was created following an online tutorial fofr SeeFood in the beggining of my learning journey. In order to be able to implement ARKit and a CoreML model on a bigger project, I used some online tutorials to code smaller things, such as SeeFood.

## Usage

1. Pick if you're going to use a camera roll image or open the camera to take a new picture

2. If you picked the gallery option, just select the image, click the lightning icon and you'll receive the model's results

3. If you chose the camera option, take a picture first and then confirm that you want to use it
